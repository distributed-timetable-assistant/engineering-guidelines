# Programming Languages

Welcome to the Languages section of the Dita Engineering Guidelines. Here you will find specific standards, best practices, and tooling requirements for the programming languages we use.

## Supported Languages

**Goals of this section:**
*   Ensure consistency across codebases.
*   Promote language-specific idiomatic practices.
*   Define standard tooling and configuration (linters, formatters).
